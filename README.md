# python_flask_db
 I want to share with you my experience using tools and concepts to create a simple API solution.

I'm using: a) Phyton b) Flask c) SQLite d) Postman

In a restful API I'm using the verbs : 
POST - To insert information into a database 
GET - To recover information from a database.
PUT (I'm not using) - To update information into a database.
DELETE (I'm not using) - To delete information from a database.

The next objective is to create a full CRUD API.
